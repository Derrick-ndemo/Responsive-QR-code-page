## My process

considering the layout of the project I started by making a div container (qrCodeScanner) so as to give the overall view of the main content accompanied with some styling

Added anoter div container (content) to hold the image and the text below the image. This was closely followed by another div element(text) that held all the text provided

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learnt quite a few things spesifically in CSS

I had some problems in trying to fit the image accurately and so here is what I learned;

```css
header img {
    max-width: 100%;
    height: auto;
    padding: 10px;
    border-radius: 15px;
}
```

### Continued development

Being a newbie developer, I want to get my hands as dirty as possible in terms of html, css and javascript before I can move on to other frameworks


### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow) - This helped me in adding box shadows. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Resource 2](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_responsive.asp) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand different aspects of a responsive page. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
